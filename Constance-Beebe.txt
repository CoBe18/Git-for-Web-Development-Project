QUESTIONS

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        An in-line element will not automaticall insert a new line, whereas the block element can.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        Absolute is a "fixed" position - it no longer takes up space. It no longer has "set" coordinates.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
                    Use a <div></div>

4. (a)Name 3 elements that are display block by default, (b)2 elements that are display inline by default, (c)and 1 element that is display inline-block by default.
        a. <div>
           <h1> - <h6>
           <p>

           <nav> 
          

        c. <button>
           <input> 
           <select> 
           <textarea>
